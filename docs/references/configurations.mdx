# Configurations

This document provides instructions for loading configuration file for Infinity and descriptions of each configuration entry.


## Load configuration file


<Tabs
  defaultValue="docker"
  values={[
    {label: 'Docker', value: 'docker'},
    {label: 'DEB/RPM', value: 'binary'},
    {label: 'Embedded Infinity', value: 'embedded'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="docker">

To load a configuration file when you start up Infinity using Docker:

1. Mount the directory for the configuration file to inside the Docker container.
2. When running Docker, specify the configuration file path using the `-f` option. For example: 

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name infinity -v /var/infinity/:/var/infinity --ulimit nofile=500000:500000 --network=host infiniflow/infinity:nightly -f /var/infinity/infinity_conf.toml
   ```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="binary">

If you start up Infinity from DEB or RPM, the configuration file will be in the `/usr/etc` directory. When the Infinity service starts, it will load this configuration file.

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="embedded">

Infinity embedded does not have an *explicit* configuration file. Its configuration file should meet the following requirements:

- It is in the local folder where Infinity embedded is opened (the path that you specify when calling `connect()`), for example `/var/infinity/`:
- Its name must exactly matche **infinity_conf.toml**.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
