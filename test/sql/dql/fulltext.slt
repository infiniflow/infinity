You combine those things with [[standardization]], [[centralization]], concentration, and synchronization, and you wind up with a style of [[organization]] we call [[bureaucracy]].” * '''Third Wave''' is the [[post-industrial society]]. Toffler would also add that since the late 1950s most countries are moving away from a Second Wave Society into what he would call a Third Wave Society. He coined lots of words to describe it and mentions names invented by him ([[super-industrial society]]) and other people (like the [[Information Age]], [[Space Age]], [[Electronic computer|Electronic]] Era, [[Global Village]], [[technetronic]] age, scientific-technological revolution), which to various degrees predicted demassification, diversity, knowledge-based production, and the
