# Arrow C++ Dataset

The `arrow::dataset` subcomponent provides an API to read and write
semantic datasets stored in different locations and formats. It
facilitates parallel processing of datasets spread across different
physical files and serialization formats. Other concerns such as
partitioning, filtering (partition- and column-level), and schema
normalization are also addressed.

## Development Status

Alpha/beta stage as of April 2020. API subject to change, possibly
without deprecation notices.
