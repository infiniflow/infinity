Bloom filters are used to quickly check whether an element is part of a set.
Xor filters and binary fuse filters are faster and more concise alternative to Bloom filters.
Furthermore, unlike Bloom filters, xor and binary fuse filters are naturally compressible using standard techniques (gzip, zstd, etc.).
They are also smaller than cuckoo filters. They are used in [production systems](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend).

This is a simple C header-only library. It implements both binary fuse and xor filters.


To use the state-of-the-art binary fuse filters, simply add (for example) the `binaryfusefilter.h` file to your project.  It is made available under the business-friendly Apache license.


For a simple application built on this library, see
https://github.com/FastFilter/FilterPassword

We are assuming that your set is made of 64-bit integers. If you have a set of strings
or other data structures, you need to hash them first to a 64-bit integer. It
is not important to have a good hash function, but collisions should be unlikely
(~1/2^64). A few collisions are acceptable, but we expect that your initial set
should have no duplicated entry.

The basic version works with 8-bit word and has a false-positive probability of
1/256 (or 0.4%).

```C
uint64_t *big_set = ...
binary_fuse8_t filter;
bool is_ok = binary_fuse8_allocate(size, &filter);
if(! is_ok ) {
    // do something (you have run out of memory)
}
is_ok = binary_fuse8_populate(big_set, size, &filter);
if(! is_ok ) {
    // do something (you have run out of memory)
}
binary_fuse8_contain(big_set[0], &filter); // will be true
binary_fuse8_contain(somerandomvalue, &filter); // will be false with high probability

binary_fuse8_free(&filter);
```

We also have a 16-bit version which uses about twice the memory,
but has a far lower false-positive probability (256 times smaller):
about 0.0015%. The type is `binary_fuse16_t` and you may use it with
functions such as `binary_fuse16_allocate`, `binary_fuse16_populate`,
`binary_fuse8_contain` and `binary_fuse8_free`.

You may serialize the data as follows:

```C
  size_t buffer_size = binary_fuse16_serialization_bytes(&filter);
  char *buffer = (char*)malloc(buffer_size);
  binary_fuse16_serialize(&filter, buffer);
  binary_fuse16_free(&filter);
  binary_fuse16_deserialize(&filter, buffer);
  free(buffer);
```

The serialization does not handle endianess: it is expected that you will serialize
and deserialize on the little endian systems. (Big endian systems are vanishingly rare.)


## C++ wrapper

If you want a C++ version, you can roll your own:

```C++
#include "binaryfusefilter.h"

class BinaryFuse {
public:
    explicit BinaryFuse(const size_t size) {
        if (!binary_fuse8_allocate(size, &filter)) {
            throw ::std::runtime_error("Allocation failed.");
        }
    }
    ~BinaryFuse() {
        binary_fuse8_free(&filter);
    }

    bool AddAll(uint64_t* data, const size_t start, const size_t end) {
        return binary_fuse8_populate(data + start, end - start, &filter);
    }
    inline bool Contain(uint64_t &item) const {
        return binary_fuse8_contain(item, &filter);
    }
    inline size_t SizeInBytes() const {
        return binary_fuse8_size_in_bytes(&filter);
    }
    BinaryFuse(BinaryFuse && o) : filter(o.filter)  {
        o.filter.Fingerprints = nullptr; // we take ownership for the data
    }
    binary_fuse8_t filter;

private:
    BinaryFuse(const BinaryFuse & o) = delete;
};
```


## Memory requirement

The construction of a binary fuse filter is fast but it needs a fair amount of temporary memory: plan for about 24 bytes of memory per set entry. It is possible to construct a binary fuse filter with almost no temporary memory, but the construction is then somewhat slower.

## Persistent usage

The data structure of a `binary_fuse8_t` instance quite simple. Thus you can easily save it to disk or memory-map it. E.g., we have

```C
typedef struct binary_fuse8_s {
  uint64_t Seed;
  uint32_t SegmentLength;
  uint32_t SegmentLengthMask;
  uint32_t SegmentCount;
  uint32_t SegmentCountLength;
  uint32_t ArrayLength;
  uint8_t *Fingerprints; // points to ArrayLength bytes
} binary_fuse8_t;
```

## Running tests and benchmarks

To run tests: `make test`.


```
$ make test
$ ./unit
./unit
testing binary fuse8
 fpp 0.00392 (estimated)
 bits per entry 9.04
 bits per entry 7.99 (theoretical lower bound)
 efficiency ratio 1.131
....
```

To run construction benchmarks:
```
$ make bench
$ ./bench

‚ùØ ./bench

It took 0.358196 seconds to build an index over 10000000 values.
