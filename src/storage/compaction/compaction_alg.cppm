    This is the algorithm to select segments to compact.

    After a new segment is committed, call `AddSegment` to check whether a compaction is needed
    If a compaction is needed, DO IT.
    Call `CommitCompact` after compaction is done.
    Or the compaction failed, call `RollbackCompact` to restore the structure.

    `AddSegment` and `DeleteInSegment` is called when adding segments or delete rows in commit thread
    `CommitCompact` and `RollbackCompact` is called in background thread
    So lock is needed
