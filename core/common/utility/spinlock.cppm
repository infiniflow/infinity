 * N.B. You most likely do _not_ want to use SpinLock or any other
 * kind of spinlock.  Use SharedMutex instead.
 *
 * In short, spinlocks in preemptive multi-tasking operating systems
 * have serious problems and fast mutexes like SharedMutex are almost
 * certainly the better choice, because letting the OS scheduler put a
 * thread to sleep is better for system responsiveness and throughput
 * than wasting a timeslice repeatedly querying a lock held by a
 * thread that's blocked, and you can't prevent userspace
 * programs blocking.
 *
 * Spinlocks in an operating system kernel make much more sense than
 * they do in userspace.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Two Read-Write spin lock implementations.
 *
 *  Ref: http://locklessinc.com/articles/locks
 *
 *  Both locks here are faster than pthread_rwlock and have very low
 *  overhead (usually 20-30ns).  They don't use any system mutexes and
 *  are very compact (4/8 bytes), so are suitable for per-instance
 *  based locking, particularly when contention is not expected.
 *
 *  For a spinlock, SpinLock is a reasonable choice.  (See the note
 *  about for why a spin lock is frequently a bad idea generally.)
 *  SpinLock has minimal overhead, and comparable contention
 *  performance when the number of competing threads is less than or
 *  equal to the number of logical CPUs.  Even as the number of
 *  threads gets larger, SpinLock can still be very competitive in
 *  READ, although it is slower on WRITE, and also inherently unfair
 *  to writers.
 *
 *  RWTicketSpinLock shows more balanced READ/WRITE performance.  If
 *  your application really needs a lot more threads, and a
 *  higher-priority writer, prefer one of the RWTicketSpinLock locks.
 *
 *  Caveats:
 *
 *    RWTicketSpinLock locks can only be used with GCC on x86/x86-64
 *    based systems.
 *
 *    RWTicketSpinLock<32> only allows up to 2^8 - 1 concurrent
 *    readers and writers.
 *
 *    RWTicketSpinLock<64> only allows up to 2^16 - 1 concurrent
 *    readers and writers.
 *
 *    RWTicketSpinLock<..., true> (kFavorWriter = true, that is, strict
 *    writer priority) is NOT reentrant, even for lock_shared().
 *
 *    The lock will not grant any new shared (read) accesses while a thread
 *    attempting to acquire the lock in write mode is blocked. (That is,
 *    if the lock is held in shared mode by N threads, and a thread attempts
 *    to acquire it in write mode, no one else can acquire it in shared mode
 *    until these N threads release the lock and then the blocked thread
 *    acquires and releases the exclusive lock.) This also applies for
 *    attempts to reacquire the lock in shared mode by threads that already
 *    hold it in shared mode, making the lock non-reentrant.
 *
 *    SpinLock handles 2^30 - 1 concurrent readers.
