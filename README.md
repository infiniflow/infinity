Infinity is a cutting-edge AI-native database that provides a wide range of search capabilities for rich data types such as vectors, full-text, and structured data. It provides robust support for various LLM applications, including search, recommendations, question-answering, conversational AI, copilot, content generation, data management, and much RAG (Retrieval-augmented Generation) applications

The vector search performance of Infinity on common datasets is exceptionally superior to all known open source vector databases, the higher the dimensionality the embeddings, the greater performance improvements achieved.

Infinity was released under the [open-source Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/infiniflow/infinity/blob/master/LICENSE) on December 20, 2023.

## üåü Key Features

Infinity comes with **performance**, **flexibility**, **ease-of-use**, and many features designed to address the challenges facing the next-gen RAG applications:

### Incredibly fast

0.1 milliseconds query latency with 10K QPS on million-scale vector datasets. See the [Benchmarking](https://www.example.com).


### Fused search

Supports a fused search of multi-embeddings and full text, in addition to filtering.


### Rich data types

Supports a wide range of data types including strings, numerics, vectors, and more.

### Ease-of-use

- Intuitive Python API.
- A single-binary architecture with no dependencies, making deployment a breeze.
