Infinity is an open-source AI-native database designed to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications. As a natural partner to mainstream LLMs, Infinity solves primary challenges faced by B2B applications, such as internal enterprise search, industry-specific search, in-house AI assistants, chatbots, in-house knowledge management systems, and more. Infinity empowers these applications by supporting full-text search, multi-embedding search, multiple-collection query, and fused search. 

The vector search performance of Infinity on common datasets is exceptionally superior to all known open source vector databases, the higher the dimensionality the embeddings, the greater performance improvements achieved.

Infinity was released under the [open-source Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/infiniflow/infinity/blob/master/LICENSE) on December 20, 2023.

## 🌟 Key Features

Infinity comes with **performance**, **flexibility**, **ease-of-use**, and many features designed to address the challenges facing the next-gen RAG applications:

### Incredibly fast

- End-to-end latency as low as 0.1 ms. See the [Benchmarking](https://www.example.com).
- 10K QPS on CPU: 


### Fused search

In addition to hybrid search, Infinity takes over the decision-making process previously owned by the upper-level applications, thereby simplifying complex queries considerably.

- Full-text search
- KNN-based vector search


### Rich data types

In addition to embeddings generated by LLMs, Infinity also stores structured and semi-structured data, offering support for mixed data type queries.

- Numeric
- String
- Float
- Date
- Time
- Geography

### Easy-to-use

- One binary to deploy
- Intuitive API: 
  - We carefully weighed the pros and cons of similar APIs in the market and designed our own.
