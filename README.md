Infinity is an open-source AI-native database designed to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications. As a natural partner to mainstream LLMs, Infinity solves primary challenges faced by B2B applications, such as internal enterprise search, industry-specific search, in-house AI assistants, chatbots, in-house knowledge management systems, and more.

Infinity empowers these applications by supporting full-text search, multi-embedding search, multiple-collection query, and fused search. 

Infinity was released under the [open-source Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/infiniflow/infinity/blob/master/LICENSE) on December 21, 2023.

## 🌟Key Features

Infinity comes with **flexibility**, **performance**, **ease-of-use**, and many features designed to address the challenges facing the next-gen RAG applications:

### Mixed data type query

In addition to embeddings generated by LLMs, Infinity also stores structured and semi-structured data, offering support for mixed data type queries.

### Multi-collection query

Mainstream vector databases in the market only supports queries on one collection.

### Multi-embedding query

### KNN-based fused search on full text

In addition to hybrid search, Infinity takes over the decision-making process previously owned by the upper-level applications, thereby simplifying complex queries considerably.

### Sub-millisecond search on trillion vector datasets

End-to-end latency measured in less than a millisecond on trillion vector datasets. See the [Benchmarking](https://www.example.com).

### Unified, intuitive APIs

We carefully weighed the pros and cons of similar APIs in the market and designed our own.
