Infinity is a cutting-edge AI-native database that provides a wide range of search capabilities for rich data types such as vectors, full-text, and structured data. It provides robust support for various LLM applications, including search, recommendations, question-answering, conversational AI, copilot, content generation, and many more RAG (Retrieval-augmented Generation) applications.

## 🌟 Key Features

Infinity comes with **performance**, **flexibility**, **ease-of-use**, and many features designed to address the challenges facing the next-gen RAG applications:

### ⚡️ Incredibly fast

0.1 milliseconds query latency with 10K QPS on million-scale vector datasets. See the [Benchmarking](https://www.example.com).


### 🔮 Fused search

Supports a fused search of multi-embeddings and full text, in addition to filtering.

### 🍔 Rich data types

Supports a wide range of data types including strings, numerics, vectors, and more.

### 🎁 Ease-of-use

- Intuitive Python API. See the [Python client]()
- A single-binary architecture with no dependencies, making deployment a breeze.
